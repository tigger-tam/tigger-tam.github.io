Professional Profile
 	Having started my first job at just twelve years old, I worked for the next decade and a half whilst simultaneously continuing my education. I worked my way up to assistant manager by age sixteen, was team-teaching university students as an adjunct professor at twenty-five, and have just finished up a Master’s degree in English Literature. My sixteen years in the work force have given me ample experience in leading, managing, and working in a team, as well as in more detail-oriented tasks, such as editing, grading, and data entry.
